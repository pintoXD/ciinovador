  Message Summary for Library fast_vdd1v2_basicCells.lib:
  *******************************************************
  Missing a function attribute in the output pin definition. [LBR-518]: 1
  *******************************************************
 
Info    : Created nominal operating condition. [LBR-412]
        : Operating condition '_nominal_' was created for the PVT values (1.000000, 1.320000, 0.000000) in library 'fast_vdd1v2_basicCells.lib'.
        : The nominal operating condition is represented, either by the nominal PVT values specified in the library source (via nom_process,nom_voltage and nom_temperature respectively), or by the default PVT values (1.0,1.0,1.0).
Warning : Library cell has no output pins defined. [LBR-9]
        : Library cell 'ANTENNA' must have an output pin.
        : Add the missing output pin(s), then reload the library. Else the library cell will be marked as timing model i.e. unusable. Timing_model means that the cell does not have any defined function. If there is no output pin, Genus will mark library cell as unusable i.e. the attribute 'usable' will be marked to 'false' on the libcell. Therefore, the cell is not used for mapping and it will not be picked up from the library for synthesis. If you query the attribute 'unusable_reason' on the libcell; result will be: 'Library cell has no output pins.'Note: The message LBR-9 is only for the logical pins and not for the power_ground pins. Genus will depend upon the output function defined in the pin group (output pin) of the cell, to use it for mapping. The pg_pin will not have any function defined.

Warning : In legacy_ui mode, Genus creates a blackbox as description for a module is not found. Black boxes represent unresolved references in the design and are usually not expected. Another possible reason is, some libraries are not read and the tool could not get the content for some macros or lib_cells. [CDFG-428]
        : A blackbox was created for instance 'RCVD_DATA_SHIFTREG' in file '/home/cinovador/Documents/course_files/digital_logic/verilog_files/PT2262-PT2272-enc_dec/decoder/decodificador_pt2272.sv' on line 78.
        : Check the kind of module a black box is. If it is a lib_cell or a macro, check why the corresponding .lib was not read in. This could be either due to a missing or faulty file or due to an incomplete init_lib_search_path attribute value making restricting access to the missing file. If it is a module of your design, verify whether the path to this module is a part of the files you read or else check that the init_hdl_search_path attribute is not missing some paths.
